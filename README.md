## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- Always ALWAYS add alt text! Always!!
- Size your text with 'rem', not with 'px'. I really need to look up why specifically, but with different solution revisions, I saw that this was a common mistake.
On the topice of 'rem', from what I understand, if you make any text have a rem of '2', the size of the text will double. I feel like there's more to this that I'm not understanding yet.
- Check spelling in the code. For the longest time, I thought I had coded the favicon line wrong, when it turned out I wrote down 'ref' instead of 'rel'. D'oh.

```css
margin: auto;
```

I learned about margin: auto while making this. The margin: auto; command will center a block element horizontally, which is what I needed to do.

```css
text-align: center;
```

In order to make the text aligned in the middle of the div box, I used text-align to ensure that that's possible.

```css
border-radius: 25px;
```

The border radius command will make the corners rounded, I've found out.

### Continued development

THINGS I WANT TO LOOK UP:
- What's WCAG? What even is that? It sounds important.
- Why do I need to size everything with rem instead of px? Should be easy to look up.
- There has to be a better way to resize images instead of just relying on pixels. What's a good way to resize images in a way that it will work on any resolution?


THINGS I WANT TO PRACTICE:
- I should continue to put into practice what I already know by continuing to make simple cards like this one.
- I want to try seeing if I can put div tables directly into the center some more. Would I need to really dig into flexboxes or grids for this? I know I'm going to have to really learn those eventually, so...
- Once I find out how to resize images in a way that it'll work on any resolution, I gotta put that into practice, obviously.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I'm still a total baby when it comes to coding, so I'll need to rely on sites like this just so I know what kind of things I can do with HTML/CSS. I'm fully expecting that I'll need to rely on this for a while until I gain the muscle memory for what I can do with just HTML and CSS.

## Acknowledgments

I was able to get this far in this project thanks to looking at other users' solutions, as well as feedback that was given there. If it wasn't for looking up how other users did the code, I wouldn't have known to add alt text or to use rem sizing instead of px siding. 
There's still a lot I need to learn, and I know that this isn't exactly perfect, but you know what? Finished is better than perfect, I've done what I can, the rest I think I just need some extra help with from others.
